  "about": "<p><span class='gz-accent'>Hello!</span> My name is Stefano and I am an italian software developer based in Milan. I strongly believe in good practices and team working. My career in software development <span class='gz-accent'>started back in 2016</span> but my love for this world was there since I was a kid when I was playing with CSS, HTML in order to create some custom themes for a forum.</p><p>While writing code I always try to apply some magic tricks which will transform <span class='gz-disabled'>bad</span> code into <span class='gz-accent'>clean</span> code.<br/>I also have some experience in leading a small team for an international project.</p><p>My life is not entirely related to coding, I am passionate about every music genre and in my free time I like being a self-taught guitar player.<br/>I also like photography and whenever I can, I go for a hike in the nature with my camera.</p>",
